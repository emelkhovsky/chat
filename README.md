### Chat
Web-site uses ***flask*** and includes these subpages:
* main page
* registration page
* authorization page
* chat page 

It has a navigation bar created with ***Flask-Bootstrap***, forms created with ***Flask-WTF***. 

It uses data base ***sqlite3*** for storing of information about registered users and for storing of messages for general chat. 

Also it supports a session. That is why chat page recognizes and remembers the user who entered the message.
